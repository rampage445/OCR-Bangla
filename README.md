# Assumptions

### 1. Only images are given in a folder.
### 2. I was asked to provide titles and links alongside summaries. So, I included the news titles and links but I don't think they are relevant in this context. title_link.json contains the titles and links.

# Execution

### main.py -> program starts here
### ocr_gemini.py -> used to extract text and summarize it
### google_drive.py -> used to push csv files to a specific folder

# Preview of output

### index.html is a gpt generated file that takes csv as input and generates a table on the browser with the contents of csv file.

# Output

### output folder contains summaries.csv, setup guide google drive integration with OAuth2.pdf and video.mkv
